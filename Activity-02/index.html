    <p>Tonga, often called the <strong>Friendly Islands</strong>, is a Polynesian kingdom composed of over 170 islands scattered across the South Pacific Ocean.</p>

    <p>Captain James Cook first visited Tonga in the 1770s and was welcomed so warmly that he coined the term "<em>Friendly Islands</em>" to describe the region.</p>

    <p>The Kingdom of Tonga is a <abbr title="constitutional monarchy">C.M.</abbr>, where the King shares power with a legislative assembly. The current monarch, <strong>King Tupou VI</strong>, has ruled since 2012.</p>

    <p>Many Tongans practice traditional crafts such as tapa cloth making, known locally as <em>ngatu</em>, which is created using the inner bark of the mulberry tree and is often decorated with tribal patterns and symbols.</p>

    <p>One of Tonga’s most fascinating natural features is its active volcanic island of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haʻapai. In <cite>Scientific American</cite>, it was reported that the 2022 eruption had one of the most powerful atmospheric impacts ever recorded.</p>

    <p id="targetParagraph">Tonga is also home to a rich marine ecosystem. Divers and snorkelers are drawn to its coral reefs and crystal-clear waters. The Vavaʻu island group is especially known for its annual <em>humpback whale</em> migrations from June to November, making it a global hotspot for marine ecotourism.</p>
